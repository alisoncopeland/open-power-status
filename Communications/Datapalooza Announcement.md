# New industry-led effort to provide consumers and first responders with information about power outages. #

Today, a number of electric utilities, software vendors, and Internet companies agreed to the development and use of a voluntary open standard for the publishing of power outage and restoration information. The commitment of utilities to publish their already public outage information as structured data in an easy-to-use and common format, in a consistent location, will make it easier for a wide set of interested parties—including first responders, public health officials, utility operators and mutual assistance crews, and the public at large—to make use of and act upon this important information, especially during times of natural disaster or crisis.

- Utilities announcing their intent to help develop and/or publish information using the standard include Duke Energy, Exelon, National Grid,  SDG&E, and Southern California Edison.
- Utility vendors announcing their plans to support the standard in their software solutions include iFactor.
- Internet companies announcing their intent to use the data on their website include Google Crisis Maps and Zillow.
