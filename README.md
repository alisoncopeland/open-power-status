# PROJECT RED BUTTON

Welcome to the site for iFactor Consulting's open outage data discussion.

We are not sure of the overall scope of this initiative.  Hosting our documentation and code/data samples on a site like github allows us to introduce proposed changes and discuss them easily before deciding how to integrate them into the product.

As this initiative progresses, this site will grow.

## Specification
The exchange format specification document and example can be found in the [`specification`](/specification) directory.


## Code/Scripts
Helpful code and scripts that support this initiative can be found in the [`code`](/code) directory.
