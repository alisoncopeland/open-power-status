# What is the Outage Data Standard initiative?
This is a voluntary industry effort to develop an open standard for the sharing of power outage and restoration information. This open sharing is intended to support the efforts of utilities coordinating with the first responder community, the public health community, other emergency operations and government entities, and utility mutual aid activities during crises other outage situations. The development of a common standard will allow utilities to publish data with appropriate attribution and control to allow for rapid exchange of information as well as integration of power status data with other datasets during these events to support better situational awareness. 

# How does it work?
The open power data standard is still being developed, so specific details are not available at this time. It is expected that this format will use a hierarchical model to support both regional summary data and more detailed local power status information. The standard will be designed so that utilities with a variety of different information systems capabilities can offer comparable data, and to support progressive enhancements in data as may be required during the response to major disasters. The standard will also be designed to provide value during a full spectrum of operating conditions, from blue sky days through to major natural disasters. 

# Why is this important?
The development of an open standard for exchanging power outage and restoration information allows utilities to streamline information sharing during crucial events, enabling public health and safety officials to easily use this information to improve services and support. It is also expected that the use of an open standard format will enable other uses of this data, including communications between utilities, coordination with other elements in the commercial sector, and other ideas as yet unknown.

# Who is involved in this initiative?
A volunteer team including representatives from large utilities from the west and east of the United States, as well as key vendors delivering outage communications solutions, and representatives from the department of energy are currently involved. The group is currently working to develop draft materials and to engage additional utilities and other stakeholders as active participants and reviewers in the standards development process. 

# Where can I find out more?
A website with additional information is being developed and will be published as soon as it is available. iFactor has volunteered to facilitate and sponsor the development of this standard, and is coordinating initial efforts along with leading utilities to kick-start this effort.
