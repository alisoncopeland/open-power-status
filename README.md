# PROJECT RED BUTTON

Welcome to the site for iFactor Consulting's open outage data discussion.

We are not sure of the overall scope of this initiative.  Hosting our documentation and code/data samples on a site like github allows us to be introduce proposed changes and discuss them easily before deciding how to integrate them into the product.

As this initiative progresses, this site will grow.
