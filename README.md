# Open Power Status Initiative

Welcome to the site for Open Power Status Initiative collaboration.

This excerpt a White House press release [**FACT SHEET: Harnessing the Power of Data for a Clean, Secure, and Reliable Energy Future**](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/05/28/fact-sheet-harnessing-power-data-clean-secure-and-reliable-energy-future) explains the mandate of the Outage Data initiative... 

> **New industry-led effort to provide consumers and first-responders with information about power outages:**  Today, a number of electric utilities and technology companies agreed to the development and use of a voluntary open standard for the publishing of power outage and restoration information.  The commitment of utilities to publish their already public outage information as a structured data in an easy-to-use and common format, in a consistent location, will make it easier for a wide set of interested parties—including first responders, public health officials, utility operations and mutual assistance efforts, and the public at large—to make use of and act upon this important information, especially during times of natural disaster or crisis.
>-  Utilities announcing their intent to develop and use this standard and publish their outage and restoration information include: **Duke Energy, BGE, ComEd, PECO, SDG&E, Southern California Edison**, and **National Grid**.
>- Utility vendor **iFactor Consulting** announced its intent to support the standard in its software.
>- **Google** announces its intent to use the open outage data in its Crisis Maps and other Crisis response products.
