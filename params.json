	"body": "# What is the Open Outage Status Initiative?
This is a voluntary industry initiative to develop an open standard for the sharing of power outage and restoration information. This open sharing is intended to support the efforts of the first responder community, the public health community, other emergency operations and government entities, and utility mutual aid activities during crises in addition to the utility. The development of a common standard will allow utilities to publish data with appropriate attribution and control to allow for rapid exchange of information as well as integration of power outage data with other datasets during these events to support better situation awareness.

# How does it Work?
The open outage data standard is still being developed, so specific details are not available at this time. It is expected that this format will use a hierarchical model to support both regional summary data and more detailed local information. The standard will be designed so that utilities with a variety of different information systems capabilities can offer comparable data, and to support progress enhancements in data as may be required during the response to major disasters. The process to develop the standard is underway with key utilities from across the United States and Canada. Information will be made available soon to allow others interested in participating in the process to engage. 

# Why is this important?
The development of an open standard for exchanging power outage information allows utilities to streamline information sharing during crucial events, enabling public health and safety officials to easily use this information to improve services and support. It is also expected that the use of an open standard format will enable other uses of this data, including communications between utilities, coordination with other elements in the commercial sector, and other ideas as yet unknown. 

# Who is involved in this initiative?
A volunteer team including representatives from several large utilities from the west and east of the United States, as well as key vendors delivering outage communications solutions, and representatives from the department of energy are currently involved. The group is currently working to develop drafts materials and to engage additional utilities as either an active participants or reviewers in the standards development process.

# Where can I find out more?
A website with additional information is being developed and will be published as soon as it is available.",
