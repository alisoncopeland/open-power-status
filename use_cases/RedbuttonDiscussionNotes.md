Area vs location
-

Hesitance to provide location detail

Choose along transparency spectrum

Summary by county

Down to Entergy showing line segments

Demo showing Entergy - most transparent

Show FirstEnergy
PHI - metadata like number of poles

BPU - regulator in NJ - ordered utilities to do better in outage comm and vegetation management, focused on damage assessment driven issues

Outage information vs more extensive
How broken information can be during a major event

What problem are we trying to solve? Keep simple then complicate. Whitehouse wants May 1 announcement.

Reaggregation

Major issues-

What is a region? Uniform area definitions i.e. unincorporated areas. Zip codes, parish, county, township, borough, wards, etc. Need uniform area names across the country. Maybe each utility shares its own data for area. 
Open for business - what about portable generators?
Deliverable - github site, csv file with example data
csv - uml - output?

Provider data - utility, contact at utility for data issue
Publish time and frequency? When will it be updated if ever?
Communicate area level data vs specific outage level data
Summary data
Outage area (higher level) document and outage location document. Shared object between the area and location documents. Area level would have different things like #of crews, general conditions, overridden ETRs

Partial restorations-
Switching orders - multiple de-energized segments within one order
Incident vs. order - one part of the network may be restored before another. For a given order 90% will be restored sooner than 10% remainder
